# üêç Project Description of Programming Activities

This repository contains a series of Python programs from the programming logic module, lesson03, organized into different folders. Each folder contains a programming activity described below:

## Activity Descriptions

### Activity 01: Count from 1 to 10
**File:** `atvd01/main.py`  
The program uses a `while` loop to count from 1 to 10 and display each number.

### Activity 02: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 100
**File:** `atvd02/main.py`  
This program uses a `while` loop to sum all the numbers from 1 to 100 and displays the final result.

### Activity 03: Multiplication Table of a Number
**File:** `atvd03/main.py`  
The program prompts the user for a number and uses a `while` loop to display the multiplication table of that number from 1 to 10.

### Activity 04: Countdown from 10 to 1
**File:** `atvd04/main.py`  
This program counts down from 10 to 1 using a `while` loop and displays "Happy New Year!" at the end.

### Activity 05: Count Up to the User-Provided Number
**File:** `atvd05/main.py`  
The program prompts the user for a number and uses a `while` loop to count up to that number, displaying only the odd numbers.

### Activity 06: Sum of Positive Numbers
**File:** `atvd06/main.py`  
This program prompts the user for numbers until a negative number is entered, summing only the positive numbers provided.

### Activity 07: Multiplication Table with Condition
**File:** `atvd07/main.py`  
The program prompts the user for a number and uses a `while` loop to display the multiplication table for that number, but only for results that are multiples of 3.

### Activity 08: Average Grade Calculation
**File:** `atvd08/main.py`  
The program prompts the user for student grades until -1 is entered, calculates, and displays the average of the grades entered.

### Activity 09: Count to 10
**File:** `atvd09/main.py`  
The program uses a `while` loop to count from 1 to 10 and terminates upon reaching 10.

### Activity 10: Sum Until 50
**File:** `atvd10/main.py`  
This program uses a `while` loop to sum consecutive numbers starting from 1 and terminates when the sum reaches or exceeds 50.

### Activity 11: Valid Input
**File:** `atvd11/main.py`  
The program prompts the user for a number between 1 and 10, continuing until a valid value is provided.

### Activity 12: Correct Password
**File:** `atvd12/main.py`  
The program asks the user to enter a password and continues to prompt until the correct password (previously defined) is entered.

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the desired activity folder.
2. Run the `main.py` file using Python.

```bash
python main.py
